<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I believe a person can’t be fully defined by a CV or resume, which is why I’ve included the interests, hobbies, and personal activities that fill my spare time and make me who I am. Keep reading below to learn more!</p>

    <h3>Sky Diving</h3>
    <p>I have fallen in love with sky diving since my 18th birthday gift experience. The thrill/excitement you get once you jump out the plane is unparallel to anything else I have experienced. I’ll never forget my first time climbing to the 18,000 feet and watching my heartrate climb along with it. Sky diving reminds me that we are all possible of such great things which are achievable when we push ourselves out our comfort zones and that often our worries are not as large as we compound them to be.</p>

    <h3>Psychology</h3>
    <p>I have always found the human experience fascinating. Many different branches of phycology define the human mind as different things. My personal favourite is "we are the sum total of our experiences" - Maya Angelou. Knowing how the mind/people work has also brought great advantages in my social life, relationships as well as working environment. I would credit my strong social skills to my continual reading in this area.</p>

    <h3>Xbox Ambassador</h3>
    <p id="xbox-paragraph">I have been an ambassador for the Xbox community for 4 years. We collaborate on software testing, as well as produce content for various events including; mental health awareness week, LGBT month & inclusion within gaming. Gaming allows me to unwind after a busy day but can also be mentally stimulating. My preferred genres are strategy and survival simulation games.</p>
