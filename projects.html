  <p>Filler text that really does not mean very much. This text is only here as to provide an atheistic representation
    of what a lot of text would look like right here and right now. Hopefully when I actually think of something to type it will be more profound.</p>
  <p>Being interested in Physics (as well as owning a 3D printer) means I am able to create a lot of interesting side projects. Most recently this involved 3D printing a boat, and building an ion engine for it. Ion engines expel electrons in order to generate forward thrust. Although the boat didnâ€™t move swiftly, I still learnt a lot creating this project & had a lot of fun in the process.</p>
  <p>During my degree, I developed a keen interest for web development. For my final assignment, I decided to create this website, coding the HTML, CSS, & JavaScript by hand to demonstrate my abilities and serve as an online portfolio.</p>
