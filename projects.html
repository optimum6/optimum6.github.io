    <h3>Commercial Project<br>(Financial skills presentation)</h3>
    <p>Throughout the past year I have developed a financial awareness presentation targeting GCSE age. This presentation aims to teach the younger generation about money management, credit cards, banking, & even the stock market. This is something I became quite knowledgeable in during my 2 years working for BT and I wanted to be able to help others learn the value of early investing. I have since presented this to two secondary schools.</p>

    <h3>Personal Project<br>(Ion thruster engine)</h3>
    <p>Being interested in Physics (as well as owning a 3D printer) means I am able to create a lot of interesting side projects. Most recently this involved 3D printing a boat, and building an ion engine for it. Ion engines expel electrons in order to generate forward thrust. Although the boat didnâ€™t move swiftly, I still learnt a lot creating this project & had a lot of fun in the process.</p>

    <h3>Student Project<br>(Coding this site)</h3>
    <p>During my degree, I developed a keen interest for web development. For my final assignment, I decided to create this website, coding the HTML, CSS, & JavaScript by hand to demonstrate my abilities and serve as an online portfolio.</p>
