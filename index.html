        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p class="bio-paragraph">​As a natural born answer-seeker I have always been interested in seeking the reason for things. Ranging from "What's the real difference between extroverts and introverts" to "How was the universe created and where will it be in a billion years time". Having grown up in the digital transformation age where the entire history of the human race is now in my back pocket and only a Google search away, I have constantly tried to develop my understanding of the world and progress my skills in areas I find fascinating. After completing my GSCE's and A-levels and securing my first job I quickly realised that my natural strengths lend me to be adaptable and strong suited to guiding and directing roles. I love interacting with people and working with them to bring out their best self. This ranged from teaching additional classes in school to being a mentor for the Xbox Ambassador program.  I enjoy pushing myself and being given the independence and trust to complete tasks to the best of my current ability and then some. Nothing is too complicated for a willing mind, time, persistence and the internet.</p>

There was little company guidance at this time, and so I had to design my own instructions to provide colleagues with.
